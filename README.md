# BarkingBuddies

## Description
Barking Buddies is a dynamic web application that brings dog lovers together. It provides a platform for users to create profiles for themselves and their furry companions, discover new friends who share their love for dogs, and establish connections by becoming "buddies." This application stores user and dog information securely, allowing users to revisit their profiles, and make new friends at any time.
